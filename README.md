# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A console-based implementation of the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.

---

## Features
- A 3x3 board where two players (X and O) compete.
- Validates player input and checks for invalid moves.
- Automatically determines the winner or declares a draw.
- Implements a reusable `BoardGame` abstract class for extensibility.

---

## How to Play
1. Players take turns entering a number (1-9) corresponding to the board's grid position.
2. The game alternates turns between "X" and "O".
3. The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If all slots are filled and no winner is declared, it results in a draw.
